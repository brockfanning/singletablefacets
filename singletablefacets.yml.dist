# Configuration file for SingleTableFacets.
#
# This should be copied somewhere OUTSIDE of the publicly available files. Ie,
# if the docroot is /var/www/htdocs, this file should be somewhere above that,
# such as /var/www, or adjacent, such as /var/www/libraries/singletablefacets.
#
# You can have any number of these files, named differently, to set up multiple
# instances of SingleTableFacets. Each time you invoke SingleTableFacets, either
# on a web page or on the command line (for refreshing the data) you reference
# this configuration file.
#
# Because this is a YAML file, remember that whitespace is important.

# Database credentials
database name: myDatabase
database user: myUser
database password: myPassword
database host: localhost

# Per the name of this library, we look at only a single table.
database table: myTable

# Indicate the columns that are required to have data in order for a row to
# appear in the search results. For example, if you don't want any rows to show
# up with titles, make your title column a required column here.
required columns:
    - myDatabaseColumn1

# Choose the order that you would like the columns to show in the facet list,
# and indicate the human-readable labels to display above each one.
facet labels:
    myDatabaseColumn1: Filter by something
    myDatabaseColumn2: Filter by something else

# Choose the order that you would like the fields to show in search results,
# and indicate the human-readable labels to display above each one.
search result labels:
    myDatabaseColumn2: Something
    myDatabaseColumn1: Something Else

# Choose the priority (order) and default direction for the sortable columns.
# ASC = ascending, DESC = descending
sort directions:
    myDatabaseColumn1: ASC
    myDatabaseColumn2: DESC

# List the columns that contain keywords in the database.
keywords in database:
    - myDatabaseColumn1

# List the columns that contain URLs pointing to files with keywords.
keywords in files:
    - myDatabaseColumn2

# List the columns that should be output as links, using another columns to
# get the destination URLs.
output as links:
    # Link label : Link URL
    myDatabaseColumn1: myDatabaseColumn2

# List the facet columns that should be collapsed at a certain point. Use 0 to
# collapse all items, or for example, 5 to collapse items in excess of 5.
collapse facet items:
    myDatabaseColumn1: 0
    myDatabaseColumn2: 5

# List the columns that should function as additional values for another facet.
# For example, if you have a Tag and Tag2 column, you could indicate that Tag2
# is just additional values for Tag, and they would both appear together.
# This is the ONLY way to give one item multiple values in a single facet.
columns for additional values:
    # Extra column: Main column
    myDatabaseColumn1: myDatabaseColumn2

# List the facet columns that depend on other facets. For example, if you don't
# want "Sub Category" to appear unless "Category" is active, you can set that
# here. This is the only way to imitate a hierarchical setup, and works well
# with "show dependents indented to the right" below.
dependent columns:
    # Child column: Main column
    myDatabaseColumn1: myDatabaseColumn2

# Indent dependents to the right and hide their titles. This gives the effect
# that they are being shown in a hierarchical way.
show dependents indented to the right: true

# List the HTML table columns you would like to give a minimum width (CSS).
# This can be used to cut down on undesirable text wrapping.
minimum column widths:
    myDatabaseColumn1: 75px

# Do not consider keywords shorter than this number.
minimum valid keyword length: 3

# Next to facet items, show the totals in parenthesis.
show counts next to facet items: true

# Choose the text for the keyword search button.
search button text: Search

# Choose the text for the message that shows when there are no results.
no results message: |
    <p>
        Sorry, no results could be found for those keywords.
    </p>

# Display the facet items as checkboxes instead of links.
use checkboxes for facets instead of links: true

# For each page of results, show this many results.
number of items per page: 20

# In the pager, show direct links to this many pages. (Besides the normal
# "Next" and "Previous" buttons.)
number of pager links to show: 5

# Show this blurb in an expandable section beneath the keyword search.
keyword help: |
    <ul>
        <li>Use the checkboxes on the left to refine your search, or enter new keywords to start over.</li>
        <li>Enter multiple keywords to get fewer results, eg: cat dogs</li>
        <li>Use OR to get more results, eg: cats OR dogs</li>
        <li>Put a dash (-) before a keyword to exclude it, eg: dogs -lazy</li>
        <li>Use "" (double-quotes) to match specific phrases, eg: "the quick brown fox"</li>
    </ul>

# Users will click this label to expand the help text above.
keyword help label: "Need help searching?"

# The items within a given facet are normally sorted alphabetically, but setting
# this to true will sort them by their counts, in descending order.
sort facet items by popularity: false

# When crawling remote URLs for keywords, add this prefix to any relative URLs.
# For example, if this is set to: "http://example.com/files/", then a relative
# URL of "mydoc.pdf" will be fetched from "http://example.com/files/mydoc.pdf".
prefix for relative keyword URLs: http://example.com/files/

# Normally keywords are processed to remove common words and such. This is a
# good thing in general, but if you expect your users to be searching for
# specific phrases/sentences that are in the documents, you might want to set
# this to false. For example, if this is set to false, and you are indexing a
# PDF that contains "The brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", it would have
# keyword data that is saved in exactly the same way: "The brown fox jumped over
# the lazy dog". However, if this is set to true, the keywords might be saved
# as "brown fox jumped lazy dog". So if someone were searching for that exact
# phrase, the desired result would not show up.
remove common keywords: true

# Normally when users do a keyword search, the full text (crawled) data is
# included. However if you would like to exclude the full text by default, and
# give the user the option to include it, set this to true.
allow user to exclude full text from keyword search: false

# If the environment needs to use a proxy, uncomment and fill out this section.

# To prevent the use of the proxy for certain URLs, enter partial patterns here.
# proxy exceptions:
#    - .example.com

# If there are any special characters or phrases that need to be altered when
# importing the data from the CSV file, indicate those here. For example, to
# change all occurences of ยง with &#167; uncomment the lines below.
